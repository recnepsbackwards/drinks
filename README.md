# Favorite drink voting page
What function would this finished project achieve:

A group of people could vote for their favorite drinks and then a poll would be displayed of the drink rankings.

Goal:

This was an exercise in bootstrap to learn more about how to utilize a template.

What I learned:

Bootstrap is a framework that decreases the amount of time spent establishing a code base to work with. 
It can also conflict with a .css file that the developer creates as bootstrap will take precedent.
This made manipulating content much harder as some selectors were not working as intended. 
It led me to spend much more time on things that had previously been much easier to implement- such as a carousel or lining up buttons centered below an image.

What I would like to accomplish in the future with this project:

I would like to revisit this project and learn how to deal with the hierarchy of css with more ease.
Also give the buttons functionality in a poll aspect.
